The best part about this method is that you don't have to download anything, fill out any surveys, or risk getting scammed or infected by malware. You also don't have to worry about the legality or quality of the keys, as they are all official and verified by Steam. You can also find other free Steam keys for different games on the website, such as Octopath Traveler II, Fallout 4, and more.

## Method 2: Use G2A Website
 
Another way to get Skyrim Steam product key for free is to use a website called G2A.

You can find many cheap deals for Skyrim Steam product key on G2A, as well as other games and items.
 
However, unlike Valid Steam Keys website, G2A is not affiliated with the developers or publishers of the games. This means that some of the keys sold on G2A may be obtained from unauthorized sources or resellers, which could result in them being invalid or revoked by Steam. Therefore, you should always check the seller's rating and feedback before buying anything from G2A. You should also use G2A's protection service called G2A Shield, which guarantees that you will get a working key or a full refund in case of any problems.
